    <h1 class="headline">Union General is a Modern ‘General Store’</h1>
    <p class="copy">The Union General offers a largesse arrangement of home goods, kids items, bath+body and baked goods in a cozy, homey, bite-size setting. Housed since 1997 in an 1850 parsonage in historic downtown Clarkston, the Clarkston Union and the Union Woodshop's sister store is filled with old school charm and curiosities edited with a whimsical yet focused eye. Pop in for a cheeky card and leave with a freshly baked cupcake, bubble bath, cookbook or toy harmonica!
